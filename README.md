**Course**: DS   <br/>
**Mod**: Mod  2              <br/>
**Topic**:  Factorials and Recursion  <br/>
**Amount of time**:  45 minutes to 1 hour <br/>
**Author**:

#### Lesson Summary:

This lesson introduces the concepts of factorials and recursion with a quick introductory paragraph. Students are then asked to analyze and explain a provided example of a recrusive function for a specific case. (The example provided calculates the product of a list of numbers using recursion.) Students are then asked to write their own function to recursively calculate the factorial of a given number. (This final exercise can be pushed to an extension if time is limited.)

#### Topic:

Factorials and recursion.

#### Prerequisite knowledge/ Prework:

Working knowledge of writing functions in python.

#### Learning goals for this lesson:

* Practice writing recursive functions
* Understand the mathematical concept of factorials and some applications

#### Misconceptions / Notes

* Recursion is often a a difficult concept for students to grapple with. Be sure to have students explicitly outline how the provided example runs for the simple test case. Have them outline each call to the function. This is also an appropriate time to reinforce concepts regarding local and global namespaces.

#### Materials
- Ipython notebook

#### Vocab / Concepts 

* Factorial
* Recursion/ Recursive
* Namespace


#### Lesson Outline:

* Introduction
* Discussion
	* What happens in the first call to the function?
	* What happens in the second call to the function? ....etc.
* Factorials! (Independent / Paired time to work)
* Review / Discussion of student work
